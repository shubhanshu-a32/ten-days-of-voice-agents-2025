    "summary": "Variables are containers that store values in programming. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put information and retrieve it later. Variables have a name and a value. For example, 'age = 25' creates a variable named 'age' that stores the number 25. Variables are useful because they let you reuse values throughout your code without rewriting them, make your code more readable by giving meaningful names to values, and allow values to change as your program runs.",

    "id": "loops",
    "title": "Loops",
    "summary": "Loops are programming constructs that let you repeat an action multiple times without writing the same code over and over. There are two main types: for loops and while loops. A for loop repeats a specific number of times or iterates through a collection of items. For example, 'for i in range(5)' runs 5 times. A while loop continues repeating as long as a condition is true. For example, 'while count < 10' keeps running until count reaches 10. Use for loops when you know how many times to repeat, and while loops when you need to repeat until a condition changes.",

    "id": "functions",
    "title": "Functions",
    "summary": "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help organize your code and avoid repetition. A function has a name, can accept inputs called parameters, performs some operations, and can return a result. For example, a function called 'calculate_area' might take width and height as parameters and return the area. Functions make your code more modular, easier to test, and simpler to maintain. You define a function once and can call it many times throughout your program.",

    "id": "conditionals",
    "title": "Conditionals",
    "summary": "Conditionals allow your program to make decisions and execute different code based on whether conditions are true or false. The most common conditional is the if statement. For example, 'if temperature > 30: print(hot)' only prints 'hot' when the temperature exceeds 30. You can extend this with 'elif' (else if) for multiple conditions and 'else' for a default action. Conditionals are essential for creating programs that respond differently to different situations, like validating user input or choosing between different actions.",
    "sample_question": "How do conditionals work and why are they important in programming?"

    "id": "lists",
    "title": "Lists and Arrays",
    "summary": "Lists (or arrays) are data structures that store multiple values in a single variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each item, you can group related items together. For example, 'colors = [red, blue, green]' stores three colors in one list. You can access items by their position (index), starting from 0. Lists are powerful because you can add items, remove items, sort them, search through them, and iterate over them with loops. They're essential for working with collections of data like user names, scores, or product inventories.",
